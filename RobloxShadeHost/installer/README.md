# Installer

Requires Inno Setup 6. The installer includes RobloxShadeHost and offers ReShade with full add-on support, every effect package from ReShade's official list, the presets from `presets/`, and the optional DLSS5 and depth estimation add-ons.

After installing Inno Setup, configure and build:

```powershell
cmake -S . -B build -A x64 -DBUILD_TESTING=ON
cmake --build build --config Release --target installer
```

Output: `build/installer/RobloxShadeHost-Setup.exe`.

ReShade is downloaded from reshade.me at installation time. Setup displays the license from that version's source tag before running the official installer. A failed ReShade download or installation stops before copying files, so the user can retry or deselect it. Reinstalling preserves existing ReShade settings.

Effect packages come from `EffectPackages.ini` in the `crosire/reshade-shaders` repository, the same list the ReShade installer uses. Each package is extracted into `reshade-shaders/Shaders` and `reshade-shaders/Textures`, skipping the files the list denies. Those folders are added to the search paths in `ReShade.ini`. A failed package download stops installation.

The presets component reads `presets/downloads.ini` from the `main` branch, downloads each listed preset, verifies its SHA-256, and checks that every effect the preset references was installed. Presets go into `presets/`; existing files are not overwritten. To add a preset, commit it to `presets/` and add its filename and hash to `presets/downloads.ini`.

The DLSS5 component reads `downloads.ini` from the `dlss5-assets` release. Both downloads must pass their SHA-256 checks before either is installed. Missing downloads, a missing or invalid manifest, or `enabled=0` skip DLSS5. The finish page reports the skipped component; the setup log records the reason. Cancelling a download stops preparation.

The depth estimation component works the same way with `downloads.ini` from the `depth-assets` release, which lists `onnxruntime.dll` and `DirectML.dll` from that release and `depth-anything-v2-small.onnx` from Hugging Face. Manifest URLs must point at this repository's releases or at huggingface.co.

Credits appear before component selection and are installed as `CREDITS.txt`. Removal requests go to **tiago@mouta.me**.

## Maintaining the downloads

The manifest sources and asset release notes are in `vendor/dlss5/` and `vendor/depth/`. The binaries belong in release assets, not Git. Upload updated `downloads.ini` to the same release when changing download URLs or checksums. The installer reads that release asset, so an application release is not required to update it.

To withdraw an add-on, remove its binary assets or upload a manifest with `enabled=0`. Older installers will skip it on their next run. Existing installations are not changed.

## Unattended installation

Host only:

```powershell
.\RobloxShadeHost-Setup.exe /VERYSILENT /SUPPRESSMSGBOXES /NORESTART /COMPONENTS="host"
```

To install ReShade unattended, first read its license and explicitly pass `/ACCEPTRESHADELICENSE=1`. Select `host,reshade` with `/COMPONENTS`, adding `reshade\presets` for the presets, `reshade\dlss5` for DLSS5 and `reshade\depth` for depth estimation. Use `/LOG="setup.log"` to record download failures.

Uninstall removes installed binaries and the shortcut. It retains ReShade settings and files created later by the user.

## Verification

Run `./tests/installer_tests.ps1` after building the host. The tests compile an installer without uninstall registration or shortcuts and install into fresh folders under `build/installer-tests`. They check component selection, license acceptance, effect and preset installation, configuration preservation, and unavailable DLSS5 and depth downloads. Internet access is required for ReShade.

Add `-DownloadDLSS` or `-DownloadDepth` to also download the published add-on files and verify their hashes against the repository manifests.
